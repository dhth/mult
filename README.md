‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

### Specify number of runs

```bash
mult \
    -n=10 \
    yourcommand --with=flags --and=args as usual
```

### Ask for number of runs

```bash
mult \
    -i \
    yourcommand --with=flags --and=args as usual
```

### Run sequentially

By default, `mult` executes all runs concurrently. Use `-s` for sequentially
execution.

```bash
mult \
    -s \
    yourcommand --with=flags --and=args as usual
```

### Add delay (in milliseconds) between runs

```bash
mult \
    -s \
    -delay-ms=500 \
    yourcommand --with=flags --and=args as usual
```

### Stop at first failure

```bash
mult \
    -s \
    -ff \
    yourcommand --with=flags --and=args as usual
```

*Note: `-delay-ms`, `-ff` only apply in sequential run mode.*
